    """
    FGES is an optimized and parallelized version of an algorithm developed by Meek [Meek, 1997]
    called the Greedy Equivalence Search (GES). The algorithm was further developed and studied
    by Chickering [Chickering, 2002]. GES is a Bayesian algorithm that heuristically searches
    the space of CBNs and returns the model with highest Bayesian score it finds. In particular,
    GES starts its search with the empty graph. It then performs a forward stepping search in
    which edges are added between nodes in order to increase the Bayesian score. This process
    continues until no single edge addition increases the score. Finally, it performs a backward
    stepping search that removes edges until no single edge removal can increase the score.
    The causal_algorithms requires a decomposable scoreâ€”that is, a score that for the entire DAG model
    is a sum of logged scores of each variables given its parents in the model. The causal_algorithms
    can take all continuous data (using the SEM BIC score), all discrete data
    (using the BDeu score) or a mixture of continuous and discrete data
    (using the Conditional Gaussian score); these are all decomposable scores.
